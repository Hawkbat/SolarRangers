    "GENERAL_INTRO_1_CHOICE_1": "Cadet? You must be mistaken, I'm not--",
    "GENERAL_INTRO_2_1": "What was that, cadet? Are you questioning your superior officer?",
    "GENERAL_INTRO_2_CHOICE_1": "No sir! Sorry sir!",
    "GENERAL_INTRO_3_1": "Good! Now then, let's get you briefed on the situation.",
    "GENERAL_MAIN_1": "Any questions, cadet?",
    "GENERAL_MAIN_CHOICE_1": "Solar Rangers?",
    "GENERAL_MAIN_CHOICE_2": "Invaders?",
    "GENERAL_MAIN_CHOICE_3": "Your orders?",
    "GENERAL_MAIN_CHOICE_4": "Ready for action, sir!",
    "GENERAL_MAIN_CHOICE_5": "Nothing else, sir!",
    "GENERAL_RANGERS_1": "You hit your head out there, cadet?",
    "GENERAL_RANGERS_2": "The Solar Rangers are the last bastion of freedom and justice in the outer wilds!",
    "GENERAL_RANGERS_3": "Using our superior technology and firepower, we defend settlers and other peaceful folk from the dangers lurking in deep space.",
    "GENERAL_INVADERS_1": "That's right! An invasion! The nefarious Eggmund Empire is preparing to conquer this solar system!",
    "GENERAL_INVADERS_2": "See that unsightly planetoid beneath us? That's one of their dastardly Egg Star battlestations!",
    "GENERAL_INVADERS_3": "The Egg Star has a powerful superlaser capable of blowing up the sun itself, which would kill us all!",
    "GENERAL_INVADERS_4": "To keep the community of the outer wilds safe, we must repel these invaders!",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_1": "Due to... unplanned circumstances, you're our only spaceworthy ranger, so it's all up to you, cadet!",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_2": "First, you'll need to destroy all of the reinforcement beacons on the outside of the Egg Star.",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_3": "Some of those beacons will be shielded, so you'll need to use your laserscope or scout-grenade to take them out on foot.",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_4": "That should force the main hatch to open up, allowing you to make your way into the vulnerable interior and reach the reactor core.",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_5": "Once you've found it, blow that reactor core sky high and get the hell out of there!",
    "GENERAL_INVASION_1": "Good! Then--",
    "GENERAL_INVASION_2": "Sweet mother of stars, they're here!",
    "GENERAL_INVASION_3": "Now get to your ship, cadet! We've just outfitted it with the latest armaments! Go take down those eggheads!",
    "GENERAL_EXIT_1": "Good! Now get to your ship, cadet! That's an order!",
    "GENERAL_VICTORY_1": "Excellent job, cadet! With the Egg Star destroyed, the citizens of our beloved Outer Wilds are safe once more!",
    "GENERAL_VICTORY_2": "Our sun is definitely safe from exploding via superlaser now, so I think we can all rest easy for a while.",
    "GENERAL_VICTORY_3": "And speaking of a well-deserved reward, I think it's time. I'd like to officially offer you a promotion!",
    "GENERAL_VICTORY_4": "Everyone, please give a round of applause for our newest Ranger! Hip hip hooray!",
    "GENERAL_VICTORY_CHOICE_1": "Thank you, sir. It's been an honor.",
    "NOMAI": "Ranger Ibex",
    "NOMAI_ENTRY_1": "Welcome back, cadet!",

    "NOMAI_VICTORY_1": "Welcome back, and well done, ranger! Those eggheads won't be coming for us any time soon!",
    "OWLK": "Ranger Hornbill",
    "OWLK_ENTRY_1": "The Solar Rangers help out the community, so we do what we can in return.",
    "OWLK_ENTRY_2": "That's why I decided to sign up and become a Ranger myself.",
    "OWLK_ENTRY_3": "You should speak with the General. He's got a plan to deal with this invasion.",

    "ERNESTO_MAIN_CHOICE_2": "What are you doing here?",
    "ERNESTO_MAIN_CHOICE_3": "Shouldn't we be... fighting or something?",
    "ERNESTO_MAIN_CHOICE_4": "Catch you later.",
    "ERNESTO_CYBERNETICS_1": "I mean, yeah. Duh.",
    "ERNESTO_CYBERNETICS_2": "But it looks pretty cool, right?",
    "ERNESTO_HIDING_1": "What are any of us doing here, really?",
    "ERNESTO_HIDING_2": "We only exist for a brief 22-minute span out of the trillions of years this universe has existed, and now everything is about to die.",
    "ERNESTO_HIDING_3": "Is the universe really cyclical? Is there anything that comes after the end? Does our life here truly have a purpose, or is it just random chance?",
    "ERNESTO_HIDING_4": "Does just being here, sharing this brief moment of existence with each other, give us meaning? Is existence itself the source of all fulfillment, however brief?",
    "ERNESTO_HIDING_CHOICE_1": "No, I mean, why are you here, on Timber One?",
    "ERNESTO_BREAK_1": "Oh. Smoke break.",
    "ERNESTO_PEACE_1": "I guess? Kinda feels like that goes against the whole 'spirit of companionship' thing this game has going for it, though.",
    "ERNESTO_PEACE_2": "Actually, this whole invasion feels pretty silly. I'm not even sure what we're supposed to be fighting over.",
    "ERNESTO_PEACE_3": "Me and the Egg Emperor, Third of His Name, Conqueror of Space and Time, Annihilator of the Stars... we go way back, actually. Shared a dorm in college.",
    "ERNESTO_PEACE_4": "How about I give him a quick call and we get this whole thing sorted out?",
    "ERNESTO_PEACE_CHOICE_1": "Nah, that's fine. I'll just stop the invasion the normal way.",
    "ERNESTO_PEACE_CHOICE_2": "You know what? Sure. Let's do it.",
    "ERNESTO_PEACE_MISSED_1": "Not much point now that the invasion is over. I'm more of a lover than a fighter, anyway.",
    "ERNESTO_PEACE_MISSED_2": "It's a shame we didn't get a chance to talk earlier, before the fighting started. Maybe we could've avoided this whole thing, somehow."
