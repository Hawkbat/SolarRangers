    "GENERAL_INTRO_1_1": "About damn time you showed up, cadet! Abandoning your duty as a Solar Ranger? The invaders will be launching an attack any minute now!",
    "GENERAL_INTRO_1_CHOICE_1": "Cadet? You must be mistaken, I'm not--",
    "GENERAL_INTRO_2_1": "What was that, cadet? Are you questioning your superior officer?",
    "GENERAL_INTRO_2_CHOICE_1": "No sir! Sorry sir!",
    "GENERAL_INTRO_3_1": "Good! Now then, let's get you briefed on the situation.",

    "GENERAL_RANGERS_3": "Using our superior technology and firepower, we defend settlers and other peaceful folk from the dangers lurking in deep space.",
    "GENERAL_INVADERS_1": "That's right! An invasion! The nefarious Eggmund Empire is preparing to conquer this solar system!",
    "GENERAL_INVADERS_2": "See that unsightly planetoid beneath us? That's one of their dastardly Egg Star battlestations!",
    "GENERAL_INVADERS_3": "Using fractal hyperdimensional spacetime folding, they've packed an entire armada of attack ships inside, just waiting to strike!",
    "GENERAL_INVADERS_4": "To keep the community of the outer wilds safe, we must repel these invaders!",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_1": "Due to... unplanned circumstances, you're our only spaceworthy ranger, so it's all up to you, cadet!",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_2": "First, you'll need to destroy all of the reinforcement beacons on the outside of the Egg Star.",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_3": "Some of those beacons will be shielded, so you'll need to use your laserscope or scout-grenade to take them out on foot.",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_4": "That should force the main hatch to open up, allowing you to make your way into the vulnerable interior and reach the reactor core.",
    "GENERAL_ORDERS_5": "Once you've found it, blow that reactor core sky high and get the hell out of there!",
